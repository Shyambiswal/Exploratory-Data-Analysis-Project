This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Telco Customer Churn dataset. It includes data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis to understand customer behavior and churn patterns. Key steps include:

Handling missing values and data preprocessing

Visualizing churn trends using plots

Conducting correlation and regression analysis

Extracting insights to improve customer retention strategies

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels
nsights from the Telco Customer Churn EDA
The Telco Customer Churn analysis helps understand why customers leave a telecom service provider. The dataset contains various features like customer demographics, service usage, contract details, and monthly charges. Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we aim to:

Why We Did This Analysis?
Identify Churn Patterns: Understanding the characteristics of customers who leave the service.

Find Key Drivers of Churn: Detecting which factors (e.g., contract type, monthly charges, tenure) influence customer retention.

Data-Driven Decision Making: Providing insights that can help businesses develop customer retention strategies.

What This Analysis Shows:
Higher churn rates among customers with month-to-month contracts compared to those on yearly contracts.

Customers with higher monthly charges tend to leave more frequently, suggesting price sensitivity.

Tenure plays a significant role – newer customers churn more often than long-term ones.

Certain services affect churn – customers without tech support or online security are more likely to leave.

Demographic insights – younger customers tend to churn more, while senior citizens are more stable.

Outcome & Business Application:
The findings help telecom companies develop targeted retention strategies such as offering better contract options, discounts for new users, and improved customer support services.
